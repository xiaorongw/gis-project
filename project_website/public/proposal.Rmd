# Project Motivation

Children are the future of a nation's wellbeing. There is therefore an incentive for the nation to ensure the healthy development of a child into adulthood.  

There have been studies on the how built spaces affect the development of children. Based on recurring key factors identified across these studies, geospatial analysis of Singapore’s neighborhoods can be conducted, to map and understand geospatial gaps, pinpointing risk areas that might require intervention.  

This is especially relevant for public housing, that is sometimes at a disadvantage compared to private housing where developers are already incentivized or expected to provide some of these built environment factors (e.g. green spaces, recreation spaces). As such, risk areas for childhood development in public housing will be the focus area for this project.

<br>

# Project Objective

Through this project we aim to:

•	Investigate the spatial distribution of key factors of the built environment affecting child development, relative to public housing estates in Singapore.
•	Identify high risk areas for childhood development, based on the built environment
•	Provide possible recommendations to mitigate these risks
•	Utilise open source data to build a proof of concept web-based geospatial application.

# Literature Review

To enable a more evidence-based project, we conducted literature reviews that will allow us to analyse and develop a web-based GIS application to identify neighborhoods with child development risk.

## Review research on built environment relationship to child development 
To understand the current state of the art in terms of built environment and its relationship to child development, we identified key literatures that draw from existing research knowledge and which have conducted real world experiments to identify these relationships. Through this literature review we aim to identify overarching development domains and their built environment factors to be utilised in our analysis and project. 

### Literature Review 1: [Relationship between the neighbourhood built environment and early child development](https://doi-org/10.1016/j.healthplace.2017.08.010)

**Aim**
The researchers utilised area level data from the Australian Early Development Census (AEDC), that spatially maps the location of children who are developmentally vulnerable to identify if there are statistically significant relationships to built environments
**Methods**
To achieve the research aim they utilised the AEDC data to identify 3 child development domains:
1.	Physical Health and Wellbeing - whether children are healthy, independent, and physically ready for the school day, and their gross and fine motor skills
2.	Social Competence - children's overall social development including how they play, share and get along with other children
3.	Emotional Maturity - whether children are able to concentrate during the school day, help others, are patient and not aggressive or angry.

In the AEDC data, children can be developmentally vulnerable in none, any and all of these domains. The researchers then utilised GIS to develop area level measures of the various Australian local communities (walkability, availability of greenspaces, availability of child specific destinations etc.). They then utilised logistic regression to model variations in the communities and the odds of development vulnerability.

The choropleth maps below shows the spatial variation in the odds of children being developmentally vulnerable in the different development domains. 

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.retina=2}
knitr::include_graphics('/images/lit1choro.png', error=FALSE)
```

**Research Findings**
The researchers were able to statistically identify that there are relationships between built environment and child development. Additionally they identified certain factors such as:
•	Children living near big yard and green spaces had the lowest odds of poor emotional development
•	Neighborhoods with less traffic result in kids with less odds of poor social development 
•	Physical health improved the further away a school, childcare and park is (could be due to exercise received by children who walk to these locations)

**Key Takeaways**
The research has provided us with useful child development domain definitions and possible factors (e.g. Walkability, Green Space, Child Specific Destinations) that we can utilise as reference to create a risk matrices. This I especially useful reference in the Singapore context, where there is currently no similar publicly available definitions and research on built factors or on child development statistics. 
From these matrices we will then be able to better derive risk scores for Singapore’s public housing neighbourhoods.

### Literature Review 2: [Levels of Influence in the Built Environment on the Promotion of Healthy Child Development](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/263324193_Levels_of_Influence_in_the_Built_Environment_on_the_Promotion_of_Healthy_Child_Development)

**Aim**
The author discusses the effects of the built environment on healthy child development, which is a departure from traditional research which focuses on the relationship of the built environment with child diseases and exposure to hazards and risks.

**Methods**
To study the impact of the built environment on healthy child development, the author first established key elements of child development, so that the relative influence of specific built environment factors can be investigated for each element. With reference to other research studies, the author defined the key elements of child development as:
1.	**Social knowledge and competence**, which refers to the awareness of general standards of acceptable behaviour in a public place, the ability to control one's own behaviour and cooperate with others in working together on assignments, appropriate respect for adult authority, and the skills to communicate feelings and wants in socially acceptable ways.
2.	**Emotional development and maturity**, which refers to the self-confidence to try new tasks and not fear failure.
3.	**Language and cognitive development**, which refers to the ability to understand and communicate with others, as well as to perceive, organize, and analyze the masses of information provided by the social and physical environments.
4.	**Healthy physical development**, which includes physical readiness for activities of daily life, physical independence, motor skills and general vitality and resistance to illnesses.
5.	**Communication skills and general knowledge**, which refers to the ability to clearly communicate one's own needs and to understand others, active participation in story-telling and interest in general knowledge about the world

To understand the extent of impact of the built neighbourhoods on healthy child development the author then turns to empirical research from other studies. In particular, Oliver, et al. (2007) uses multi-level modelling, a statistical technique that can separate out the proportion of total variance in the outcome that can be attributed to the neighbourhood level, and the proportion of variance that can be attributed to the household level.

**Findings**
The studies suggest that child development aspects such as physical health and well-being, language and cognitive development and communication skills and general knowledge are more strongly influenced at the neighbourhood level.

**Key Takeaways**
The study provides positive evidence that the built environment can be altered to enhance several aspects of healthy child development. 
* Infrastructure that encourages physical activity can enhance physical well-being of children.
* Community recreation facilities and early learning programs that encourages cognitive, language and communication skills can significantly increase the external stimuli for children to develop lifelong skills.
The study therefore provides useful childhood development domain definitions that can be utilised in this project, in union with those identified from the previous literature review. It also provides evidence of a relationship between the built environment and various aspects of child development, which can be utilised in this project to identify Singapore-specific built factors (e.g. playgrounds, community centres) that can influence child development.

## Review research on Accessibility Analysis 
Based on current research, the relationship between built environments and child development is often in relation to how accessible a certain built factor is to a child (e.g. accessibility to playgrounds, accessibility to greenspaces). As such, it will be useful for the project to conduct literature review on current state of the art methods for accessibility analysis, and how they are being utilised.

### Literature Review 1: [Accessibility analysis (Concepts and their application to transport policy, programme and project evaluation)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/283927928_Accessibility_analysis_Concepts_and_their_application_to_transport_policy_programme_and_project_evaluation)
**Aim**
The researcher aims to encourage the usage of accessibility analysis in policy formulation, through defining and educating current available accessibility analysis methods and providing a real-world case study on its usage 
**Methods**
To achieve this aim the researcher first identifies that most accessibility analysis measures can be grouped under three general but similar indicators, these are:

1.Simple Indicators
Representation of transport and/or opportunity within the accessibility equation is simplified into thresholds. Time and distance thresholds adopted within these measures will depend upon the policy issue that we are analyzing. It can be applied to either the opportunities (i.e. shopping centres with more than 5,000 square metres floor space) or the deterrence functions (e.g. jobs within 60 minutes travel time), or both. 
Under this indicator, the accessibility measure for a specified location (i) is calculated as a sum of the opportunities available at alternative locations (j) within the defined threshold. The notation for this indicator is as follows:

A_i=\sum{O_j\delta_{ij}}

Where \delta=\ 1 if the opportunity is within the generalised time or cost threshold, and \delta=\ 1 otherwise.   

Example calculations/indices under this indicator are: 
* Catchment/contour indices - Count/Number of people, jobs shops etc. within a threshold travel cost or buffer (distance, time etc.) from a defined location
* Walking access time to public transport 
* Time space geographic measures – Total Opportunities available within a travel time budget

2. Opportunity Measures 
The indicator assess accessibility by utilising a measure of deterrence (based upon how easily an opportunity can be reached) as a weight for the sum of all opportunities. Therefore, the opportunity measure for a location (i) is calculated by the sum of opportunities at (j) factored by the deterrence function, which is based on the travel time between i and j.

A_i=\ \sum O_j\ exp(-\alpha t_{ij})

Where exp(-\alphat) is the deterrence function, and Oj is the opportunity available within zone j. The deterrence function is calibrated utilising the \alpha factor. This deterrence function will usually be calibrated based on observed local travel patterns so as to provide accurate trip distributions. 

Example calculations/indices under this indicator are: 
* Hansen Indices 
* Shimbel Measures 

3. Value Measures 
The value measure aims to define the attractiveness of the available opportunities to represent their values as a transport choice. It utilises the same input data as the opportunity measure but the equation is further transformed so that it is represented in terms of the value of  generalized opportunities in time, or cost. An example equation is as follows:

A_i=\ \frac{1}{\alpha}ln\frac{\sum O_j\ exp(-\alpha t_{ij})}{\sum O_j\ }

Example calculations/indices under this indicator are: 
* Utility based measures - These measure the value to an individual or group of the choices available to them. The indices are less sensitive  to large  changes  in  number  of  opportunities  so  are relatively  more  sensitive  to  transport  changes

**Research Findings**
Based on these indicators identified the researcher further presented a case study on a Scottish research which utilised the accessibility measures to analyse the accessibility from different parts of  Edinburgh  to  the  new  Royal Infirmary (that was under construction at the point of study). They created the below choropleth visualization, where the darker shades are areas with good accessibility. Through this alternative transport strategies can be tested and evaluated on their effectiveness (e.g. intro of new bus services).

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.retina=2}
knitr::include_graphics('/images/lit3scots.png', error=FALSE)
```

**Key Takeaways**
The researcher provides a compelling argument on the usage of accessibility analysis in the process of policy planning. He provides the below figure as an example of how the policy planning process can enable planners to study impacts to more user groups without affecting the complexity of the demand modelling.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.retina=2}
knitr::include_graphics('/images/lit3policy.png', error=FALSE)
```

This is especially thanks to deterrence functions in accessibility measures that allows for localized calibrations and as such provide a more evidence-based resolution to policy planning. 
Through this project we aim to also affect changes in policy planning through an evidence-based approach. As such it will indeed be useful to utilise accessibility analysis in this project. It will especially be useful in assessing the child developmental risk scores of Singapore’s neighbourhoods.

# Methodology 
Based on the literature reviews conducted we can start to formulate a possible method to tackle the research problem and identify neighbourhoods that child developmentally at risk.

The project will take the following steps in its development:
+ Identify key domains for child development and their corresponding built environment factors, based on existing research (Physical Health and Wellbeing, Social Competence, Emotional Maturity).
+ Retrieve Data from data sources and conduct data cleaning and transformation. 
+ Formulate risk matrices based on built environment factors (e.g. Proximity to Greenspaces).
+ Spatially map and analyse built factors and their spatial relation to public housing (e.g. Point Pattern Analysis)
+ Utilise risk matrices to create risk scores for each HDB new town (e.g. Accessibility Analysis)
+ Identify areas at risk in relation to public housing (e.g. Localised Geospatial Analysis)
+ Propose recommendation for improvement and highlight key findings 
The methodology embarked on this project will be iterative, with us revisiting previous steps based on our initial findings. This will allow the project to go deeper in understanding the spatial relationships and to identify areas for improvement.

# Application Design Storyboard
Below are the storyboards where envisioned to serve as a guide in the development of this application. 

## Map Page 
The map page will allow users to view the various analysis we have conducted (e.g. Point Pattern, Localised Geospatial etc.), they will be able to click into the view and select specific subzones to look closer at. They can also select to show built features (greenspaces, schools, recreation spaces etc.) based on its relation to child development domains. 
```{r echo=FALSE, fig.retina=2}
knitr::include_graphics('/images/storyboard1.png', error=FALSE)
```

Users will additionally also be able to view the various risk scores generated for each public housing and will be able to further view the breakdown by subzones. 

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.retina=2}
knitr::include_graphics('/images/storyboard2.png', error=FALSE)
```

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.retina=2}
knitr::include_graphics('/images/storyboard3.png', error=FALSE)
```

## Data Explorer
The data explorer tab allows users to explore the datasets that we utilise in a tabular form. This will help them to understand the underlying data that was used in our analysis and in this applications. 

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.retina=2}
knitr::include_graphics('/images/storyboard4.png', error=FALSE)
```

# Application System Architecture

The Project will be developed utilising R as it will allow us to utilise geospatial analytics and data manipulation packages in union with R Shiny to create an integrated web-based GIS application. The R shiny application runs on a shiny server, to be hosted by shinyapps.io along with the data for the application. The data and maps will be loaded by the application and displayed to the user whenever they access the application.

| Data Cleaning and Geospatial Wrangling                                                   | Raw data are not always formatted appropriately or clean for immediate analysis as such it is essential to take documented steps to clean data and to conduct regular data sanity checks                                                                                           |
| Lack of research on relationship between built spaces and child development in Singapore | In the absence of such research we will be relying on research from other countries as a reference point to be utilised in our project here in Singapore\. For future works we may be able to more specifically fit the local context with the availability of such research\.     |
| Inexperience with R Shiny                                                                | As this is a new package that we are exploring it will be challenge to utilise its full abilities, as such to mitigate and over come this challenge we will have to regularly consult documentation and conduct regular testing to ensure our application is working appropriately |
